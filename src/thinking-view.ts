// Click gestures are ONE rule set for streaming and completed runs:
//  single click  collapsed ↔ peek, full → collapsed
//  double click  peek ↔ full, collapsed → full
//
// The single action is DELAYED by DOUBLE_CLICK_MS for one reason: the host
// recognizes a double click by COMPONENT IDENTITY, and every rebuild makes a
// new wrapper (streaming rebuilds on every chunk). Acting on the first click
// would both reset that identity and shrink the block before the second click
// lands. Holding the single action keeps the geometry and the gesture intact;
// the pending click is cancelled by the second click (double), by dispose, and
// by a session reset (no timers outlive their transcript).
